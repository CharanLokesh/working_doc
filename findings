As we are using jenkins on public-ip the jenkins console will take too much time to respond and react hence you will face lag in application 
(this is because jenkins will be hsted on public ip and when u stop and start the server ip gets change and somewhere in meta data it is directed to old ip itself
so you will face lag in accessing the application so when u replace this with elastic ip, elastic ip won't chnage by starting and stopping teh server so it will be accesable 
quickly)
so we have to create elastic ip and associate that to jenkins ec2 server 
and also we need to update the ip address on jenkins host with this elastic ip

Steps to update the elastic ip
        Connect to Jenkins EC2 instance using Git bash or iTerm:
        Navigate to Jenkins installation directory:
        cd /var/lib/jenkins/ 
        Modify jenkins.model.JenkinsLocationConfiguration.xml file by executing below command: (this file will be viewed only after installing jenkins and configuring it completly)
        sudo nano jenkins.model.JenkinsLocationConfiguration.xml
        Make sure you provide Jenkins current URL in below location and restart Jenkins.
        sudo service jenkins restart
        Now try accessing Jenkins through UI, it will be really performing well.
        
        Second option us using Jenkins UI
        Change public URL under Manage Jenkins-System
        Change Jenkins URL to current Jenkins URL:
        Click on Apply and Save.
        that's it. You will notice Jenkins is performing well now.
